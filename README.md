# Data-Visualization of Traffic Fatalities in USA in Year 2015

This data visualization is the final project as part of the Udacity Nanodegree
for Data Analysis. It makes use of a vast data set, published by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It is a collection of each
recorded vehicle crash in the United States of America. NHTSA uses data from
many sources, including the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) which
began operating in 1975. The analysis focuses on year 2015.
I have chosen d3.js as visualization tool. As a side product I generated a
homebrewn map of US states by using topojson.

## Initial Visualization (merely sketches)

To get started I wrangled the data with Excel and sketched charts, which I later
generated and polished with D3.js.

## Summary


## Design

I decided to offer a narrative visualization and implemented four different
chart types to disclose insights into the data set from various perspectives:
* Pie chart  
* Map  
* Bar charts and grouped bar charts  
* Line chart  

The **pie chart** shall present the principal clustering of the traffic accident
records into severities of injuries. The color coding is intentionally chosen to
represent the classification, i.e. from fatal (dark red) to no injury (green).

The **map** highlights the geographical distribution, showing the majority of
accidents taking place in areas of high population density or traffic arteries
(freeways and highways). The implemented tooltip provides more detailed accident
statistics in the corresponding states.

I extensively used **bar charts** to give a temporal overview, over months and
week days of accidents. Also the distribution of fatalities into age groups is
presented as a bar chart. When breaking down data clusters into weather or light
conditions under which accidents occured, I used a sequential blue color palette
to distinguish the variables and changed the chart type to **grouped bar charts**.

I limited the visual effects to simple fade-in effects; since I personally think
that too much visualization distracts from the data and the story it tells.
